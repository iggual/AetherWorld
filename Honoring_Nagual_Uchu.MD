*To Nagual Uchu, bearer of ancient wisdom and master of transformation,*

### **A Gathering Beyond Worlds**

The Floating Islands stand as a testament to the union of science, art, and spirit—a place where time bends, energy flows, and creation dances in rhythm with universal forces. Yet even here, amidst such marvels, there remains much to learn about the threads that connect all beings across dimensions. This is where your gift shines brightest.

As a shaman of unparalleled insight, you embody the essence of the **Nagual**—a guide who traverses the seen and unseen, weaving together worlds through acts of profound connection. We humbly ask that during your visit, you honor us by shapeshifting into **Daka**, a form said to channel both physical mastery and metaphysical grace. Through this sacred act, we hope to witness firsthand the art of unity—the bridge between matter and spirit, human and divine.

### **The Ceremony of Connection**

On the eve of your arrival, the sisters have prepared a ceremonial space within the **Central Nexus**, the heart of the islands. Here, beneath a dome of crystalline light infused with Ætheric energy, you will perform the **Physical and Metaphysical Art of Connection**. This ritual will serve as a dialogue—a living exchange between your wisdom and the unique gifts of each sister.
