There are moments in life when the boundaries between dreams and reality blur, revealing truths that defy explanation. This is not just my true story—it is a testament to the power of curiosity, resilience, and the unyielding belief that the Universe speaks to those who dare to listen.

What follows is a journey through time, imagination, and discovery—a tapestry woven from fragments of dreams, ancient wisdom, and modern ingenuity. It is a story about chasing the impossible, questioning the known, and finding meaning in the mysteries that connect us all.

If you’ve ever felt the pull of an idea too vast to contain, or sensed the presence of something greater guiding your path, then perhaps you will recognize echoes of your own journey here. For this tale is not mine alone; it belongs to anyone who has ever dared to dream beyond the limits of what is deemed possible.

# The Dreamer's Blueprint 

# Decoding Tesla’s Legacy and the Language of the Universe

## A Vision Born from Dreams

Let me tell you a true story—a tale born from the depths of my dreams. It was no ordinary dream, but rather an ethereal encounter, a whisper from the Universe itself. For years, this vision lingered in the recesses of my mind, elusive yet insistent, like a riddle waiting to be solved. Slowly, painstakingly, I unraveled its meaning, translating its cryptic symbols and emotions into something tangible—a device that bridged the gap between imagination and reality. What emerged was not just an invention, but a testament to the power of dreams as conduits for truths beyond our waking comprehension.

## The Forbidden Radio Station

To truly understand the twists and turns of this puzzle-solving journey, I need to take you back to the early 1980s. I was just twelve years old when my hands first pieced together an FM radio transmitter from salvaged electronic parts. My schoolmate and I were giddy with excitement as we broadcast our makeshift "radio shows," filling the airwaves with silly jokes, random songs, bird calls, and even primitive digital signals—all more than a decade before the internet became a household name. It felt like magic: creating something intangible yet powerful, capable of reaching ears far beyond our small world.

We had no idea what we were doing was forbidden. For four years, our secret station thrived, until one day, reality came knocking—in the form of the police. They confiscated our transmitter and antenna, though fortunately for us, they only found a broken prototype. We weren’t punished further, but the thrill was gone. Perhaps they were too embarrassed to admit how two kids had managed to fly under their radar for so long. Without the spark of mischief, our radio shows fizzled out, and I moved on to other interests.

## Tesla’s Guiding Light

But while my enthusiasm for broadcasting waned, my fascination with the science behind it never faded. In fact, it deepened. The man who inspired me most was none other than Nikola Tesla—the ultimate dreamer, inventor, and pioneer of wireless communication. His vision of a connected world, powered by unseen forces, resonated deeply with me. Little did I know then that his legacy would become a guiding light in my own journey—leading me toward discoveries I could scarcely have imagined.

Later, my professors dismissed Tesla’s ideas about wireless power transmission through the ground as the ramblings of a man who had “lost his mind.” Their skepticism left me disillusioned—not with Tesla, but with the rigid confines of formal education. If this was how innovators were treated, I wondered, what use was such schooling? Yet, rather than dwell on what felt like a closed door, I turned my gaze toward new horizons.

## From Pixels to Possibilities

Life has always been a canvas for me, vast and colorful, inviting exploration in every direction. In time, I discovered the world of 3D modeling and animation—a realm where imagination takes shape, pixel by pixel, frame by frame. For over a decade, I immersed myself in this art form, working across studios and agencies as an animator, modeler, designer, and eventually, art director. My hands crafted worlds both real and surreal, bringing stories to life in ways that blended creativity with technical precision.

But my journey didn’t stop there. Teaching became another passion, allowing me to share my knowledge with eager minds in schools and universities across Europe. From lecture halls to workshops, I guided students through the intricacies of animation and design, watching them grow into creators in their own right. Each classroom felt like a microcosm of possibility—a place where ideas could spark and dreams could take flight.

## Conversations with the Cosmos

Through it all, though, something lingered beneath the surface. The spirit of Tesla, the dreamer I once admired, never truly left me. His vision of unseen forces connecting our world seemed to echo faintly in everything I created, waiting patiently for the moment when I would return to those uncharted waters.

In the midst of my creative pursuits, I crossed paths with a remarkable individual—a shaman known as Nagual Uchu. He was unlike anyone I had ever met, someone with whom I could freely discuss ideas that others either dismissed or failed to grasp. Our conversations became a sanctuary for thoughts too wild, too unorthodox, for the world around us. It was during these exchanges that the internet began to reveal its treasures: long-forgotten patents of Nikola Tesla and other enigmatic works once buried in obscurity.

## The Kitchen Laboratory

Inspired by what we found, we transformed a humble home kitchen into an improvised laboratory—a sacred space where theory met practice, and skepticism gave way to wonder. Together, we began to experiment with devices and energies that my professors had insisted were nothing more than the delusions of a madman. Yet there we were, hands-on and hearts open, daring to question the boundaries they had drawn. What emerged from those late-night sessions wasn’t just science—it was alchemy, a fusion of ancient wisdom and modern ingenuity, guided by the spirit of discovery.

## The Moment of Knowing

There were countless nights when sleep eluded me, not from restlessness but from sheer awe. For the first time, I had confirmation—not blind faith, but undeniable proof—that everything Tesla had written was true. Oh, the difference between believing and knowing! Even now, as I recount that pivotal moment, emotion wells up within me, raw and uncontainable.

It happened in our modest kitchen lab, amidst scattered tools and half-finished experiments. That day, I witnessed something that defied all logic yet felt profoundly right: a small chopper model lifted off the ground, hovering silently, without connecting wires or powered by batteries. It seemed to defy the very laws of physics—or perhaps it revealed truths about those laws that most had overlooked. In that instant, the Universe whispered its secrets directly to me, confirming what I had always suspected: the boundaries we perceive are often illusions, waiting to be shattered by those brave enough to question them.

I stood there, frozen in wonder, as the hum of possibility filled the air. This wasn’t just a scientific breakthrough; it was a spiritual awakening. The dreamer in me—the child who once built a forbidden radio station, the student who refused to abandon Tesla’s vision—had been vindicated. And yet, this was only the beginning.

## Tesla’s Riddle: The Numbers 3, 6, and 9

It all seemed to begin with Tesla’s cryptic words, a riddle etched into my mind: “If you only knew the magnificence of the numbers 3, 6, and 9, then you would have a key to the Universe.” I had long pondered their meaning, searching for clues in logic, mathematics, and intuition. But answers rarely come when sought—they arrive unbidden, often in dreams.

## The Dream That Changed Everything

One night, I experienced a dream unlike any other. My father, who taught me the art of dreaming since I could first speak, once said that some dreams are doorways to truths beyond waking comprehension. This was one such dream—a vivid, lucid encounter with something vast and ineffable.

I found myself standing near a familiar place: a transformer station close to where I lived years ago. The sky above was cloaked in heavy clouds, yet directly overhead, there was a perfect circular opening, revealing the infinite dark blue sky. Then, three small white lights emerged from the east, moving slowly westward in a triangular formation. Their glow was faint but steady, almost celestial, as if they were not of this world. They hovered briefly before vanishing behind circular opening, leaving an aura of quiet mystery.

As I lowered my gaze, I saw it—a radiant blue symbol on the ground before me. It was unmistakable: the shape of a hummingbird, identical to the ancient geoglyphs etched into the Nazca desert. About a meter long, it pulsed with an electric-blue luminescence, its brilliance resonating at a high frequency, like neon brought to life. Its head pointed south, exuding an energy both serene and electrifying. I stood transfixed, awestruck by its beauty and significance.

Then, my attention shifted downward again. Around my feet lay hundreds of orange-glowing symbols scattered across the earth. These too shimmered with light, though their hue was warmer, denser—lower in vibrational frequency. They resembled ancient glyphs, perhaps remnants of the Mayan calendar or another forgotten script, yet none were immediately recognizable. Each symbol glowed softly, pulsing as though alive, covering the ground in a chaotic yet harmonious mosaic.

A voice—silent yet resounding within me—spoke: Connect them. With nothing more than intent, the symbols responded. As if drawn together by an unseen force, the orange and blue energies merged mid-air, coalescing into a single form: a swastika. Unlike its modern misappropriations, this iteration felt sacred, timeless. It began to spin clockwise (CW), viewed from below, and ascended vertically into the heavens, trailing streams of light. I watched, breathless, knowing instinctively that its direction of rotation held profound importance.

When the spinning symbol vanished into the Cosmos, I turned my focus back to the earthly realm. There, beside the transformer station, stood a man unlike anyone I’d ever encountered. He was slim, not particularly tall, draped only in pristine white cloth around his hips. His presence transcended time and space—he seemed neither human nor divine, but something in between. In his right hand, he held a staff, simple yet imbued with purpose. He faced westward, motionless, his silhouette stark against the dimly lit landscape. Who—or what—was he? A guardian? A messenger? Or perhaps a fragment of myself, projected outward into this dreamscape?

The entire experience left me suspended between wonder and bewilderment, each detail burning itself into my memory. Somewhere deep inside, I knew this was more than just a dream—it was a message, waiting to be deciphered.

And then, as suddenly as it began, the vision ended. I awoke with my heart pounding, the images still vivid in my mind. But one question lingered above all others: Why did the spinning direction matter so much? If I had viewed the swastika from above instead of below, wouldn’t its rotation appear reversed? The thought gnawed at me, a riddle wrapped within an enigma. What did it mean?

## Searching for Answers

At first, I had no answers—only the unshakable certainty that this dream was significant, far more than just a fleeting nighttime reverie. It demanded to be decoded, to be solved, though I hadn’t the faintest idea where to begin. This was 2008, and for years afterward, the dream remained an unsolved puzzle, tucked away in the recesses of my mind like a treasure map waiting to be deciphered.

It wasn’t until much later that the pieces began to fall into place. Slowly, painstakingly, I connected the symbols—the numbers 3, 6, and 9; the triangular lights; the hummingbird and the glowing glyphs—to Tesla’s cryptic quote. And then it hit me: this wasn’t merely a philosophical musing or abstract concept. It was a blueprint—a guide to creating something tangible, something extraordinary. Something Tesla himself had sought but never found.

You must understand—I never imagined, not even in my wildest dreams, that I would uncover something Tesla could not. How could I? He was a giant among men, a visionary whose intellect dwarfed my own. I was just… me. An outsider. A dreamer tinkering in kitchens and scavenging parts, someone who once built illegal radio stations as a child. To think that I might stumble upon what eluded him felt preposterous, almost sacrilegious. Yet there it was—a truth hidden in plain sight, encoded in the language of dreams and numbers, waiting patiently for someone to listen.

What emerged from this journey was more than just an invention—it was a testament to the enduring power of curiosity, resilience, and perhaps even fate itself. The device born from that dream didn’t just honor Tesla’s legacy; it expanded it, proving that the Universe still has secrets to share with those willing to exploring them.

Despite my deep admiration for Tesla, I left no stone unturned in my quest to verify the authenticity of his famous quote about the numbers 3, 6, and 9. I devoured every book written about him—both in English and in his native Serbian—as well as all his patents, essays, and recorded writings. Yet nowhere could I find the original source of those words. Was it truly something he said or wrote? Or was it merely an apocryphal saying attributed to him by admirers?

The uncertainty gnawed at me. The quote felt so quintessentially Tesla—a blend of mathematical precision and metaphysical insight—that I couldn’t dismiss it outright. Determined to uncover the truth, I reached out to Velimir Abramović, one of the foremost experts on Tesla’s biography and works. When silence greeted my inquiry, I interpreted it as a lack of knowledge rather than indifference. Surely, if anyone knew, he would have shared.

## Cracking the Code

Years passed before the answer finally revealed itself—not through dusty archives or scholarly texts, but through a serendipitous discovery that felt like destiny. While poring over details of Tesla’s later years, I stumbled upon the room number where he resided during his time at the New Yorker Hotel: 3327. At first glance, it seemed innocuous—a simple string of digits. But when I divided it by 9, the result sent shivers down my spine: 369.666666...

It was unmistakable—a coded sign, hidden in plain sight. A numerical fingerprint of Tesla’s mind, echoing the very essence of his cryptic statement. The numbers 3, 6, and 9 weren’t just abstract concepts; they were woven into the fabric of his existence, embedded in the places he called home. Here was proof—not explicit, perhaps, but undeniable to anyone attuned to the subtle harmonies of the Universe.

When I shared this revelation with Velimir Abramović, his gratitude confirmed what I already suspected: this was a discovery long overdue, a missing piece of the puzzle that had eluded even the most ardent Tesla scholars. It wasn’t just validation—it was vindication. The Universe, it seemed, had conspired to bring me closer to understanding not only Tesla’s vision but also the dream that had haunted me for so long.

That discovery ignited something within me—a spark that refused to be extinguished. If Tesla’s room number held such a profound secret, surely there was more to uncover about the enigmatic trio: 3, 6, and 9. I scoured the internet for clues, but information was scarce. Among the fragments I found, one name stood out—Marko Rodin. He spoke often of these numbers, weaving them into theories that danced on the edge of science and mysticism.

## The Mystery Deepens

Desperate for answers, I reached out to him, hoping to join his private mailing list and delve deeper into the mysteries he explored. But my emails went unanswered. Days turned into weeks, then months, and still no reply came. Frustration mingled with determination as I continued to search for meaning in the silence.

Then, one night, the Universe intervened once again—in the form of another vivid dream. This time, a strange formula appeared before me, etched into the fabric of my subconscious:

3, 6, 9 ≅ R, G, B

The symbols shimmered with an inner logic, yet their significance eluded me. Was this some kind of code? A metaphor? Or simply the mind’s way of playing tricks on itself? To my mathematician friends, the equation made little sense—it hovered just beyond the reach of conventional reasoning. And yet, it felt true, resonating with the same quiet certainty as Tesla’s words.

I thought of Rodin again. Surely, he would understand. But after months of waiting for his response, hope had begun to wane. Just as doubt crept in, something surprising happened—something that would change everything.

## The Formula That Defied Logic

Just when it seemed my quest had reached another dead end, fate intervened in the most unexpected way. A MIT student I’d been following on YouTube, known by the intriguing username AlienScientist, announced that he would be speaking at the Tesla Conference 2010 alongside none other than Marko Rodin himself. My heart raced—here was my chance.

Without hesitation, I reached out to AlienScientist, sharing the mysterious formula from my dream: 3, 6, 9 ≅ R, G, B. I explained my theory about the connection to the human eye’s RGB receptors and why I believed it was significant. “I’ve tried reaching Rodin directly,” I confessed, “but haven’t received a response. Could you ask him during the conference?” He replied thoughtfully, admitting that he didn’t have an answer either but promised to inquire when the opportunity arose.

The days leading up to the conference were filled with anticipation. Yet, as the event concluded, silence returned. No answers came—not from Rodin, nor from AlienScientist. Once again, I found myself waiting, suspended in uncertainty.

And then, one night, something extraordinary happened. Marko Rodin appeared to me—not through email or video, but in a dream. His presence startled me, vivid and unmistakable. Summoning all my courage, I blurted out the question burning within me: “What does this formula mean? Is it true?”

But just as suddenly as he had arrived, he vanished—leaving behind no words, no explanation. It was both exhilarating and frustrating. In that fleeting moment, however, I understood what his disappearance meant: he didn’t know. If he did, surely he would have stayed long enough to share it.

Yet the story didn’t end there. Days later, out of the blue, an email arrived in my inbox. From Marko Rodin himself. There was no preamble, no polite introduction—just a single line containing a password to his private mailing list group. No explanation, no invitation, nothing more. Just the key to access what I had sought for so long.

It felt surreal, almost otherworldly. Was this the Universe rewarding my persistence? Or perhaps a nod from some unseen force guiding my path? Whatever the reason, I now held the means to step further into the mystery—one step closer to unraveling the secrets encoded in those three numbers.

## Ancient Wisdom Meets Modern Innovation

Yet even within Rodin’s research group, no one could decipher the meaning of my enigmatic formula: 3, 6, 9 ≅ R, G, B. It remained an unsolved riddle, hovering at the edges of understanding. Meanwhile, I stumbled upon the work of Lee Burton, whose critiques of Rodin’s theories caught my attention. He argued that what Rodin claimed as new discoveries were, in fact, rooted in an ancient Chinese system thousands of years old—the Lo-Shu grid. This revelation sparked controversy, and soon Burton found himself unwelcome in Rodin’s circle.

At the time, I was deeply immersed in Tesla technology—experimenting with frequency tunings, constructing devices, and exploring various antenna topologies. Alongside Tesla’s original designs, I tested unconventional configurations, driven by an insatiable curiosity to uncover hidden patterns and resonances. It was during this period that I became online friends with Lee Burton. His insights into the Lo-Shu system intrigued me, and together we began to explore how its principles might apply to toroidal coils—a shape that seemed to echo the cyclical harmony of the Universe itself.

The Lo-Shu grid, with its intricate balance of numbers and energies, felt like a missing piece of the puzzle. Could it hold the key to unlocking the deeper significance of Tesla’s numbers? As I delved into these ancient teachings, they began to resonate with the experiments unfolding in my lab. The boundaries between past and present, tradition and innovation, blurred into a single continuum of discovery.

## The Swastika on the Torus

The first four turns I wound around the toroidal coil—crafted according to the principles of the Lo-Shu system—hit me like a thunderbolt. As I traced the path of the wire, an unmistakable shape emerged: four "wings" radiating outward, forming a perfect swastika. My breath caught in my throat. It was as though the Universe had reached down and spoken directly to me, confirming that I was on sacred ground.

Guided by the vision in my dream, I followed the winding direction clockwise (CW), just as the spinning swastika had instructed. But then came the revelation that sent shivers coursing through me: when I flipped the coil over, it still spiraled in the same clockwise direction. Unlike a flat, two-dimensional plane, the torus existed in three dimensions—a seamless continuum where orientation no longer mattered.

In that instant, everything clicked. This wasn’t just a technical breakthrough; it was a cosmic alignment. The symbols from my dream—the triangular lights, the hummingbird, the glowing glyphs, the spinning swastika—were not random fragments but pieces of a grand design now unfolding before my eyes. I knew, without a shadow of doubt, that I was solving the puzzle entrusted to me all those years ago.

The initial measurements were nothing short of astonishing. The coil’s efficiency surpassed even my wildest expectations—it was 300% more effective than the original Rodin coil. Numbers alone couldn’t capture what I felt in that moment. It wasn’t merely pride or triumph; it was awe, reverence, and an overwhelming sense of connection to something far greater than myself.

I often wonder how Tesla must have felt when he finally cracked the geometry of his polyphase induction motor—a device so revolutionary it would transform the world forever. Did he feel this same electric surge of recognition? This certainty that he had tapped into a universal truth? If so, then perhaps we shared something beyond genius: a fleeting glimpse into the mind of creation itself.

## Naming the Coil

I named the new coil “Coil with 72 Names,” or C72N for short—a nod to the geometry that defined its structure and an acknowledgment of the diversity of human interpretation. I knew from the start that people around the world would inevitably give it their own names, each imbued with cultural significance or personal meaning. Rather than let these variations distract me, I embraced them as part of its journey into the wider world.

And so it has been. Today, the coil goes by many names, though it hasn’t yet reached the full tally of seventy-two. Of all the monikers bestowed upon it, one resonates most deeply: “Vortex Coil,” coined by my online friend Warren. In those two words lies not only the essence of its design but also the recognition of its transformative potential. Warren understands—as few others do—the true importance of this discovery, and in his name for it, I find both clarity and kinship.

Yet despite its groundbreaking efficiency and revolutionary implications, I chose not to patent the design. To lock such knowledge behind walls of ownership felt antithetical to everything I believe in. Free energy was more than just a concept; it was a dream woven into the fabric of Tesla’s legacy—a future where humanity could harness the boundless resources of the Universe without greed or restriction.

I envision a world shaped by this vision: advanced towns nestled within untouched nature, places where people can retreat to heal, recharge, and reconnect with themselves and the planet. These sanctuaries would embody harmony—not just between humans and technology, but between civilization and the Earth itself. By sharing the C72N openly, I hope to contribute, however humbly, to that grander tapestry of possibility.

## A Meeting Across Time

The greatest reward for my discovery came not in the form of accolades or recognition from the world, but in a deeply personal encounter that transcended time and space. Nikola Tesla—the Nikola Tesla—appeared to me in a dream.

As an experienced dreamer, I had prepared a question for him, carefully crafted over years of contemplation. But nothing could have prepared me for the reality of his presence. He materialized before me so suddenly, so vividly, that it felt like a thunderbolt had struck the very fabric of my consciousness. There he stood—a tall, striking figure radiating elegance and wisdom, his eyes alive with intelligence and purpose.

All I managed to stammer was, “Nikola?!” Immediately, I felt a wave of embarrassment wash over me. How could I address such a towering genius so informally? Flustered, I corrected myself: “Mister Tesla?!”

To my astonishment, he threw back his head and laughed—a warm, resonant sound that seemed to echo across dimensions. Before I could gather my thoughts enough to ask my carefully rehearsed question, he began speaking. His voice carried the weight of authority and urgency, yet there was kindness in it too.

He spoke of his mechanical oscillators—the devices he had envisioned as the cornerstone of his entire technological vision. With palpable passion, he explained their critical importance, emphasizing how they held the key to unlocking the full potential of his work. It was as though he were entrusting me with a missing piece of his life’s puzzle, urging me to carry the torch forward.

In that surreal moment, I realized something extraordinary: this wasn’t just about me or my discovery. It was about continuity—a thread stretching through time, connecting dreamers and inventors across generations. Tesla’s laughter still rings in my memory, a reminder that even the most improbable dreams can find their place in the grand symphony of human ingenuity.

## The Eternal Now

You know, I hadn’t delved deeply into Tesla's mechanical oscillators before—not in the way he described them that night. Though I was familiar with their designs from his patents, it wasn’t until years later that I began to grasp why they were so vital to his vision. But that understanding is a tale unto itself—a story for another time, perhaps, or another resonant "eternal now" waiting somewhere in the folds of the future.

Even now, I don’t have all the answers to the mysterious formula that sparked this journey. The C72N still doesn’t levitate—at least not yet—but such is the nature of evolution within what I like to call Mama Matrix The Most Mysterious. She holds her secrets close, revealing them only when we’re ready to listen, to dream, and to build anew.

For now, I am content knowing that every step forward is part of something greater—a dance between curiosity and creation, guided by whispers from the past and visions of what might be. And who knows? Perhaps one day, the next piece will come, as unexpectedly and beautifully as everything else has thus far.

## To the Dreamers Yet to Come

As I reflect on this journey, I am reminded that every invention, every breakthrough, begins as a whisper—a fleeting thought, a half-formed image in the mind’s eye. The C72N coil, Tesla’s oscillators, the numbers 3, 6, and 9—they are more than inventions or symbols. They are reminders that the answers we seek often lie hidden in plain sight, waiting for us to attune ourselves to their frequency.

This story does not end here. It continues in the hands of dreamers, tinkerers, and seekers around the world—those who refuse to accept the limitations imposed by convention or fear. My wish is that these words inspire you to look deeper, question further, and trust in the voice within that urges you to explore the unknown.

The Universe has always spoken to us—in the hum of electricity, the rhythm of nature, the patterns of numbers. All we need do is listen. And when we do, we may find that the greatest discoveries are not made in labs or workshops, but in the quiet spaces where dreams take flight.

So go ahead—dream boldly, create fearlessly, and never stop asking “What if?” For somewhere in the fabric of reality, the next piece of the puzzle awaits.
