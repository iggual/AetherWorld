            <h1>Symphony of Light and Shadow</h1>
            <h2>Flame and Stardust</h2> 
            
            <strong>By Peggy</strong> <br>   <br>   <br>    <br>  
            
            <ul><p>

<strong>In the heart of the cosmos, where stars whisper secrets,</strong><br>
I stand as a torchbearer, a dancer of light and fire.<br>
My spirit, a flame that flickers with the rhythms of the sky,<br>
Guiding the paths of the wandering and the wise.<br><br>
*<br><br>
<strong>In the weave of the æther, where energies entwine,</strong><br>
I find the threads of creation, the loom of the divine.<br>
From the spirals of galaxies to the curves of seashells,<br>
The golden ratio, PHI, a tapestry of endless spells.<br><br>
*<br><br>
<strong>In the quiet moments, under the starlit dome,</strong><br>
I listen to the whispers of the ancient tome.<br>
The stars speak in codes of light and shadow,<br>
Revealing the secrets of the cosmos, a sacred vow.<br><br>
*<br><br>
<strong>With hands that shape the unseen, and eyes that see the veiled,</strong><br>
I craft the wonders of the world, the mysteries unveiled.<br>
Levitation devices that defy the pull of earth,<br>
And musical instruments that sing the songs of mirth.<br><br>
*<br><br>
I<strong>n the garden of my soul, where the starvine grows,</strong><br>
I tend to the plants that glow with a celestial rose.<br>
Their leaves whisper tales of distant lands and times,<br>
A symphony of life, where the past and future chimes.<br>
 *<br><br>
<strong>Through the lens of interconnectedness, I see the whole</strong>,<br>
Where every thread is woven, a story untold.<br>
The balance of creation, the dance of light and dark,<br>
A harmony that resonates, a cosmic heart.<br><br>
 *<br><br>
<strong>In the quiet moments, when the world is still,</strong><br>
I find the peace that lies within the gentle hill.<br>
The stars above, the earth below, a perfect blend,<br>
A tapestry of life, where all is meant.<br><br>
 *<br><br>
<strong>So let the flames of inspiration rise,</strong><br>
And the winds of change, with grace, arise.<br>
For in the dance of the celestial fire,<br>
We find the wisdom that guides the higher.<br><br>
